# Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Anonymization for the CAHOOTS Crisis Response Organization

A project by Aussie Frost.

## Overview
I am using spaCy natural language processing and various data manipulation methods to anonymize crisis case narratives given by [CAHOOTS](https://whitebirdclinic.org/cahoots/), a local crisis response organization in Eugene, Oregon.

## Purpose
The research question I am focused on is defined as follows: "can a script reliably remove identifying information (names, phone numbers, addresses) from case narratives?".

This original question has been modified to capture more identifying information such that the output results in what is considered a Limited Data Set. The identifiers that must be removed are specified in a text file found [here](â€™notes/identifiers_to_remove.txt).

## File structure
A quick overview on the files in this repository.
